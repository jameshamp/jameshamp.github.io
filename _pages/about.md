About
=====

I am a Quantitative Researcher / Data Scientist currently employed by Citigroup in London, 
where I am head of Data & Analytics for the FX business. 
Prior to my current role, I led the development of data-driven analytics and automation 
for the FX Options trading desk at Citi.

Outside of work, I have academic interests in data science and machine learning and their application 
to problems in finance and physics. Please see [here](https://jameshamp.github.io/research) for a 
summary of my research themes, and [here](https://jameshamp.github.io/publications) for a list of my publications.
I am currently a Visiting Fellow at the Data Science Institute of the London 
School of Economics. 

Academically, I am trained as a theoretical and computational physicist. I received 
my PhD from the University of Cambridge, where I was a student of Claudio Castelnovo in the 
Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Group at the Cavendish Laboratory. 
I obtained my undergraduate Masters degree from the University of Warwick where I received the 
Styles Prize for Excellence as the top graduating student in physics. 
I retain a keen interest in physics, especially statistical physics and frustrated magnetism. 
I have also contributed to open-source projects in Python, including NumPy, Man AHL's PyBloqs package, 
PyQvd, and the Pandas documentation.
