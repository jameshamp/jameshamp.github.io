About
=====

I am a quantitative researcher / data scientist currently employed by Citigroup in London, 
where I lead the development of data-driven analytics and automation for the FX options 
trading business using modern quantitative techniques including machine learning.

Outside of work, I have academic interests in data science and machine learning and their application 
to problems in finance and physics. Please see X for a summary of my research, and Y
for a list of my publications.
From January 2024 I will be a visiting fellow at the Data Science Institute of the London 
School of Economics (LSE). 

Academically, I am trained as a theoretical and computational physicist. I obtained 
my PhD from the University of Cambridge, where I was a student of Claudio Castelnovo in the 
Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) Group at the Cavendish Laboratory. 
I received my undergraduate masters degree from the University of Warwick where I received the 
Styles Prize for Excellence as the top graduating student in Physics. 
I retain a keen interest in physics, especially statistical physics and frustrated magnetism.
